# Recommended voices for Text-to-Speech (TTS) on the Web

With hundreds of voices available by default across various browsers and OS, it can be tricky for developers to provide sensible defaults and a curated list of voices.

This repository is part of a larger project, meant to identify best practices for implementing TTS support in reading apps on all platforms. With its focus on voice selection, the goal of this project is to document higher quality voices available on various platforms and provide an easy way to implement these recommendations using JSON configuration files.

## Initial list of supported languages

* English (`en-us` and `en-gb`)
* French (`fr-fr` and `fr-ca`)
* Italian (`it-it`)
* Spanish (`es-es` and `es-mx`)
